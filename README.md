# Advent_of_Code_2024


has been a while since i tried to solve coding problems. have become quite rusty with the basic algorithms and data structures. planning to use this repo to track progress and hold myself accountable till i grow momentum :) happy holidays




1. understood the idea of intuition
2. problem solving is langiage independent
3. write the brute force solution, then optimise it
